# Brainstorming

## Workflows
<!-- Checklist for complex tasks -->
- [ ] **Define Problem**: Clearly articulate the problem statement or goal.
- [ ] **Diverge**: Generate as many ideas as possible without judgment (Quantity > Quality).
- [ ] **Categorize**: Group similar ideas into themes or clusters.
- [ ] **Converge**: Select the most promising ideas based on feasibility and impact.
- [ ] **Refine**: Flesh out the selected ideas into actionable concepts.

## Feedback Loops
<!-- Validation steps -->
1. Review selected ideas against the original problem statement.
2. Check technical feasibility with an Architect or Lead Developer.
3. Validate alignment with product roadmap and user needs.

## Utility Scripts
<!-- Reference executable scripts -->
- `scripts/generate-ideas.py`: (Hypothetical) Generates prompts to stimulate thinking.

## Reference Implementation
