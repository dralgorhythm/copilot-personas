# Writing PRDs

## Workflows
- [ ] **Define Goals**: Clearly articulate business goals and success metrics.
- [ ] **Identify Stakeholders**: List all relevant stakeholders.
- [ ] **Draft User Stories**: Write user stories to capture user needs.
- [ ] **Detail Requirements**: List functional and non-functional requirements.
- [ ] **Save Artifact**: Save the PRD to `./artifacts/prd_[feature].md` (e.g., `./artifacts/prd_authentication.md`).
- [ ] **Review**: Conduct a review with stakeholders.

## Feedback Loops
1.  Draft the PRD using the template.
2.  Review with the Product Manager and Engineering Lead.
3.  Update based on feedback.
4.  Obtain formal approval.
