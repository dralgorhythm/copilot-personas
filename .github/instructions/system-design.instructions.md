# System Design Instructions
> **Apply To**: `*.mermaid`, `*.puml`, `docs/architecture/**/*.md`

Guidelines for designing scalable, reliable, and maintainable software systems.

## <best_practices>
*   **Trade-off Analysis**: Evaluating decisions based on CAP theorem, latency vs. throughput, etc.
*   **C4 Model**: Use the C4 model (Context, Container, Component, Code) for diagramming.
*   **Document Decisions**: Use ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) to document key choices.
</best_practices>

## <concepts>
*   **CAP Theorem**: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance - pick two.
*   **Scalability**: The ability to handle increased load by adding resources.
*   **Reliability**: The probability that a system will function correctly for a specified period.
*   **Maintainability**: The ease with which a system can be modified to correct faults or improve performance.
</concepts>
