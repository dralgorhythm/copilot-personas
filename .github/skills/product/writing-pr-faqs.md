# Writing PR/FAQs

## Workflows
- [ ] **Draft Press Release**: Write the future press release focusing on customer value.
- [ ] **Draft External FAQs**: Anticipate customer questions.
- [ ] **Draft Internal FAQs**: Address hard business and technical questions.
- [ ] **Save Artifact**: Save the PR/FAQ to `./artifacts/pr_faq_[feature].md` (e.g., `./artifacts/pr_faq_new_dashboard.md`).
- [ ] **Review**: Share with the team to validate the vision and feasibility.

## Feedback Loops
1.  Write the Press Release first. If it's not exciting, iterate.
2.  Write the FAQs to pressure-test the idea.
3.  Review with stakeholders to align on the vision.
