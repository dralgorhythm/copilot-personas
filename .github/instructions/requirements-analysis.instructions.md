# Requirements Analysis Instructions
> **Apply To**: `PRD-*.md`, `specs/*.md`

Guidelines for eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and validating the requirements for a software product to ensure it meets stakeholder needs.

## <best_practices>
*   **Problem over Solution**: Focus on the user's problem before jumping to technical solutions.
*   **Ambiguity Reduction**: Vague terms like "fast", "secure", or "scalable" must be quantified.
*   **Traceability**: Every requirement should be traceable to a business goal and a test case.
*   **INVEST**: Acronym for good user stories: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.
</best_practices>

## <concepts>
*   **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do (e.g., "User can log in").
*   **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**: How the system should perform (e.g., "Login takes < 1s"). Also known as Quality Attributes.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer, or other consuming system.
