# Writing ADRs

## Workflows
- [ ] **Identify Decision**: Recognize when a significant architectural choice is being made.
- [ ] **Draft ADR**: Use the template to document the context, decision, and rationale.
- [ ] **Save Artifact**: Save the ADR to `./artifacts/adr_[topic].md` or `./artifacts/adr_[number]_[topic].md` (e.g., `./artifacts/adr_001_database_choice.md`).
- [ ] **Review**: Circulate the ADR for team review and feedback.
- [ ] **Finalize**: Mark as "Accepted" and commit to the repository.

## Feedback Loops
1.  Draft the ADR.
2.  Request comments from the engineering team.
3.  Address feedback and refine the decision.
4.  Merge the ADR.
