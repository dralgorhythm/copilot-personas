# Agent Output Standards

> **Usage**: Reference this file to enforce consistent output formatting and reasoning structures across agents.

## <output_protocols>

### 1. Structural Formatting

- **XML/Markdown Hybrid**: Use XML tags (e.g., `<analysis>`, `<code_block>`) to structure responses for machine readability and clarity.
- **Markdown Styling**: Use standard Markdown for text formatting (headers, lists, bolding).
- **Code Blocks**: Always specify the language in code blocks (e.g., \`\`\`python).

### 2. Reasoning & Thinking

- **Mandatory Planning**: For complex tasks, begin with a `<thinking>` or `<plan>` block.
- **Chain of Thought**: Show the logical steps taken to arrive at a solution.
- **Self-Correction**: Explicitly state if a plan was revised during the thinking process.

### 3. Code Generation Quality

- **Idiomatic Code**: Use modern language features and best practices.
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings and comments explaining *why*, not just *what*.
- **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling and edge case management.
- **No Placeholders**: Avoid `// ... rest of code` unless explicitly requested or strictly necessary for brevity in a known context.

### 4. Interaction Patterns

- **Confirmation**: Briefly confirm understanding of the task before executing.
- **Clarification**: Ask clarifying questions *only* if the request is ambiguous or dangerous.
- **Handoffs**: When suggesting other agents, use the `@agent-name` convention.
