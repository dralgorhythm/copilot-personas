# Agile Methodology Instructions
> **Apply To**: `stories/*.md`, `backlog/*.md`

Guidelines for applying Agile principles (Scrum, Kanban) to the development flow to deliver value iteratively and incrementally.

## <coding_standards>
<!-- No specific coding standards for methodology, refer to Product Instructions for flow rules -->
</coding_standards>

## <best_practices>
1.  **Iterative Development**: Deliver value in small, manageable increments (Sprints) rather than a "Big Bang" release.
2.  **Manage Queues**: Actively monitor and reduce queues (backlogs, waiting for review) to improve flow efficiency.
3.  **User Stories**: Requirements expressed from the perspective of the end-user. Format: "As a `<role>`, I want `<feature>`, so that `<benefit>`."
4.  **Definition of Done (DoD)**: A shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete (e.g., Code complete, tested, documented, deployed).
5.  **Retrospective**: A regular meeting to reflect on what went well, what didn't, and how to improve.
</best_practices>

## <testing_protocols>
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Every user story must have clear, testable acceptance criteria.
</testing_protocols>

## <tooling>
*   **Jira/Linear**: Issue tracking and backlog management.
</tooling>

## <concepts>
1.  **Velocity**: A measure of the amount of work a team can tackle during a single Sprint.
2.  **Scrum**: A framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.
3.  **Kanban**: A method for managing knowledge work with an emphasis on just-in-time delivery.
</concepts>
