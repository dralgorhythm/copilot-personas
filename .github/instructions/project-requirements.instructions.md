# Project Requirements Instructions
> **Apply To**: `**/artifacts/prd_*.md`, `**/artifacts/requirements_*.md`, `**/specs/*.md`

Guidelines for creating clear, comprehensive, and testable Project Requirement Documents (PRDs).

## <coding_standards>
1.  **Template Adherence**: Use the Markdown format defined in the PRD template.
2.  **Unique Identifiers**: Ensure all requirements are uniquely identified (e.g., REQ-001).
3.  **Prioritization**: Use "Must", "Should", "Could", "Won't" (MoSCoW) for prioritization.
4.  **Acceptance Criteria**: Define acceptance criteria for every functional requirement.
5.  **Version Control**: Version control the document and maintain a changelog.
6.  **Storage Location**: All requirement documents **MUST** be stored in the `./artifacts/` directory.
</coding_standards>

## <best_practices>
*   **Engage Stakeholders**: Involve stakeholders early to gather diverse insights and resolve conflicts.
*   **Be Clear and Concise**: Use plain language, avoid jargon, and define terms in a glossary.
*   **Focus on "What", not "How"**: Describe the problem and desired outcome, not the technical implementation details.
*   **SMART Requirements**: Ensure requirements are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
*   **Define Non-Goals**: Explicitly state what is out of scope to prevent scope creep.
</best_practices>

## <testing_protocols>
*   **Verifiability**: Each requirement must have at least one test case or verification method.
*   **Traceability**: Requirements should be traceable to design elements and test cases.
*   **Review Cycle**: PRDs must undergo a formal review process with engineering, design, and product stakeholders.
</testing_protocols>

## <tooling>
*   **Markdown**: Use standard Markdown for formatting.
*   **Mermaid**: Use Mermaid.js for diagrams (flows, sequence, state).
</tooling>

## <concepts>
*   **User Stories**: "As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]".
*   **Functional Requirements**: Specific behaviors or functions of the system.
*   **Non-Functional Requirements**: Quality attributes like performance, security, and usability.
</concepts>

## <visual_reasoning>
*   **User Flows**: Include user flow diagrams to illustrate complex interactions.
*   **Wireframes**: Link to or embed low-fidelity wireframes if available to clarify UI requirements.
</visual_reasoning>
