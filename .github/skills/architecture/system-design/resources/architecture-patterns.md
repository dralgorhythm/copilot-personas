# Architecture Patterns

## Monolithic Architecture

A single, unified unit.

- **Pros**: Simple to develop, test, and deploy initially.
- **Cons**: Hard to scale, single point of failure, tight coupling.

## Microservices Architecture

A collection of loosely coupled services.

- **Pros**: Scalable, independent deployment, technology agnostic.
- **Cons**: Complex to manage, network latency, distributed data consistency.

## Event-Driven Architecture

Components communicate via events.

- **Pros**: Decoupled, scalable, responsive.
- **Cons**: Complex debugging, eventual consistency.
