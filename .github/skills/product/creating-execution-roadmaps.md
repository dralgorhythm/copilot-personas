# Creating Execution Roadmaps

## Workflows
- [ ] **Define Phases**: Break the project into logical phases (Planning, Design, Dev, Launch).
- [ ] **List Actions**: Create a checklist of actionable items for each phase.
- [ ] **Assign Owners**: (Optional) Assign owners to tasks.
- [ ] **Link Resources**: Link to relevant docs (PRDs, Designs, ADRs).
- [ ] **Save Artifact**: Save the roadmap to `./artifacts/roadmap_[project].md` (e.g., `./artifacts/roadmap_2025_q1.md`).

## Feedback Loops
1.  Draft the roadmap.
2.  Review with the team to ensure realistic timelines and dependencies.
3.  Update the roadmap regularly as progress is made.
