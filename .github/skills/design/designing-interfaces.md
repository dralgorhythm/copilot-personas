# Designing Interfaces

## Overview

This skill covers the principles and practices for designing user interfaces (UI) that are intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and functional. It focuses on layout, typography, color theory, and component consistency.

## Principles

1.  **Clarity**: The interface should be self-explanatory. Users should know what to do without extensive instruction.
2.  **Consistency**: Use consistent design patterns, terminology, and visual elements throughout the application.
3.  **Feedback**: Provide immediate and clear feedback for user actions.
4.  **Efficiency**: Minimize the number of steps required to complete a task.
5.  **Aesthetics**: A visually appealing design enhances trust and usability.

## Practices

### Layout & Composition
-   **Grid Systems**: Use grid systems (e.g., 8pt grid) to align elements and create visual order.
-   **Whitespace**: Use whitespace generously to separate content and reduce cognitive load.
-   **Hierarchy**: Use size, color, and placement to establish a clear visual hierarchy.

### Typography
-   **Type Scale**: Define a limited set of font sizes and weights (e.g., H1, H2, Body, Caption).
-   **Readability**: Ensure sufficient contrast and line height for comfortable reading.
-   **Font Choice**: Use modern, legible fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto, System UI).

### Color Theory
-   **Palette**: Define a primary, secondary, and neutral color palette.
-   **Meaning**: Use color to convey meaning (e.g., red for errors, green for success).
-   **Contrast**: Ensure text has sufficient contrast against the background (WCAG AA standard).

### Component Design
-   **Atomic Design**: Build interfaces from small, reusable components (atoms) up to complex pages.
-   **States**: Design for all component states (default, hover, active, disabled, error).
-   **Affordance**: Make interactive elements look clickable/tappable.

## Tools
-   **Figma**: Primary tool for interface design and prototyping.
-   **CSS Frameworks**: Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, or styled-components for implementation.
