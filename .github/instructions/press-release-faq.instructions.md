> **Apply To**: `**/*pr-faq.md`, `**/PR_FAQ.md`

Guidelines for writing Amazon-style Press Release / Frequently Asked Questions (PR/FAQ) documents to work backwards from the customer experience.

## <coding_standards>
1.  **Structure**: Follow the "Working Backwards" structure: Press Release first, then External FAQs, then Internal FAQs.
2.  **Perspective**: The Press Release must be written as if the product has already launched.
3.  **Length**: Limit the Press Release section to 1-1.5 pages.
4.  **Dateline**: Use a future date for the Press Release dateline.
5.  **Quotes**: Include a customer quote and an internal leader quote in the Press Release.
</coding_standards>

## <best_practices>
*   **Customer Centricity**: Focus relentlessly on the customer benefit and the problem being solved.
*   **No Jargon**: Write the Press Release in simple language that a layperson can understand.
*   **Be Bold**: Articulate a clear and ambitious vision.
*   **Address Hard Questions**: Use the Internal FAQ to tackle difficult questions about feasibility, risks, and profitability.
*   **Iterate**: Treat the PR/FAQ as a living document that evolves as you learn more.
</best_practices>

## <testing_protocols>
*   **The "So What?" Test**: Does the Press Release clearly explain why a customer should care?
*   **Clarity Check**: Can someone outside the team understand the product solely from reading the Press Release?
*   **Feasibility Review**: Do the Internal FAQs adequately address technical and business risks?
</testing_protocols>

## <tooling>
*   **Markdown**: Use standard Markdown for formatting.
</tooling>

## <concepts>
*   **Working Backwards**: A product development methodology that starts with the customer experience and works backwards to the technology.
*   **Press Release**: A mock announcement describing the finished product and its value proposition.
*   **Internal FAQ**: Questions asked by internal stakeholders (engineering, product, sales, finance).
*   **External FAQ**: Questions asked by customers or the media.
</concepts>

## <visual_reasoning>
*   **Layout**: Keep the layout clean and readable, mimicking a real press release format.
