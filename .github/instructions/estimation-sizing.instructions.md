# Estimation Instructions
> **Apply To**: `backlog/*.md`, `sprint-planning.md`

Guidelines for estimating effort, complexity, and risk for tasks to enable predictable planning and delivery.

## <best_practices>
*   **Relative Sizing**: Estimate tasks relative to each other, not in absolute hours.
*   **Consensus**: Use techniques like Planning Poker to reach team agreement.
*   **Include Testing**: Estimates must include time for testing, documentation, and deployment.
*   **Decomposition**: Break down large tasks (XL) into smaller, manageable chunks.
</best_practices>

## <concepts>
*   **Story Points**: A relative unit of measure for expressing the overall effort required to fully implement a user story.
*   **Cone of Uncertainty**: The principle that uncertainty is highest at the beginning of a project and decreases over time.
*   **Velocity**: The number of story points a team can complete in a sprint.
</concepts>

## <scale>
*   **XS (1 pt)**: Trivial change (typo, config). < 1 hour.
*   **S (2 pts)**: Simple task (new field, bug fix). < 1 day.
*   **M (3-5 pts)**: Standard feature (new endpoint, component). 2-3 days.
*   **L (8 pts)**: Complex feature (new service, major refactor). 1 week.
*   **XL (13+ pts)**: Epic. Needs decomposition. > 1 week.
