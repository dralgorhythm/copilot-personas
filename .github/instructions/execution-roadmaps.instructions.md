# Execution Roadmaps Instructions
> **Apply To**: `**/artifacts/roadmap_*.md`, `**/execution-plan.md`

Guidelines for creating concise, actionable execution roadmaps for agentic workflows and product development.

## <coding_standards>
1.  **Phased Structure**: Structure roadmaps into clear phases (e.g., Foundational Planning, Design/Dev, Testing/Deployment).
2.  **Action Items**: Use a "To-Do List" format for actionable items within each phase.
3.  **Goal Alignment**: Explicitly link roadmap items to business goals or user needs.
4.  **Success Criteria**: Include a "Definition of Done" or success criteria for each phase.
5.  **Version Control**: Version control the roadmap to track progress and changes.
</coding_standards>

## <best_practices>
*   **Phased Approach**: Break down large initiatives into manageable, iterative phases.
*   **Action-Oriented**: Ensure every item is a clear action, not just a vague concept.
*   **Prioritize Foundations**: Include steps for data readiness, technical infrastructure, and governance early on.
*   **Build-Measure-Learn**: Incorporate steps for piloting, measuring KPIs, and iterating based on feedback.
*   **Risk Management**: Include steps to assess and mitigate risks (technical, business, adoption).
</best_practices>

## <testing_protocols>
*   **Completeness Check**: Does the roadmap cover the entire lifecycle from planning to post-deployment?
*   **Dependency Check**: Are dependencies between tasks and phases clearly identified?
*   **Reality Check**: Are the timelines and resource expectations realistic?
</testing_protocols>

## <tooling>
*   **Markdown**: Use Markdown checklists (`- [ ]`) for tracking progress.
</tooling>

## <concepts>
*   **Agentic Workflow**: A workflow where AI agents perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.
*   **Pilot**: A small-scale implementation to test feasibility and value.
*   **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: The simplest version of a product that allows for learning.
</concepts>

## <visual_reasoning>
*   **Hierarchy**: Use indentation to show hierarchy between phases and tasks.
*   **Visualization**: Consider using a simple Gantt chart or timeline visualization if helpful (using Mermaid).
