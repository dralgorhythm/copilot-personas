# Agile Methodology Instructions
> **Apply To**: `stories/*.md`, `backlog/*.md`

Guidelines for applying Agile principles (Scrum, Kanban) to the development flow to deliver value iteratively and incrementally.

## <best_practices>
*   **Iterative Development**: Deliver value in small, manageable increments (Sprints) rather than a "Big Bang" release.
*   **User Stories**: Requirements expressed from the perspective of the end-user. Format: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]."
*   **Definition of Done (DoD)**: A shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete (e.g., Code complete, tested, documented, deployed).
*   **Retrospective**: A regular meeting to reflect on what went well, what didn't, and how to improve.
</best_practices>

## <concepts>
*   **Velocity**: A measure of the amount of work a team can tackle during a single Sprint.
*   **Scrum**: A framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.
*   **Kanban**: A method for managing knowledge work with an emphasis on just-in-time delivery while not overloading the team members.
